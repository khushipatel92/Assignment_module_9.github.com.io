    <!-- Question:5 
    
              What is Components in React Js?

         Answer:
         
              -> Components can be nested inside other components, allowing for complex UIs to be built from simple, reusable parts.
    This modular approach to UI development makes React JS a powerful and flexible framework for building web applications.

    Components can be classified into two types: functional components and class components.
        1) Functional components:
            Functional components are simple JavaScript functions that take in props as arguments and return a React element.
            They are easier to write and read, and are preferred for simple UI elements.
                Example:
                    function Welcome(props)
                    {
                        return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
                    }

        2) Class components:
            Class components are more complex and can have their own state and lifecycle methods.
            They are useful for more complex UI elements that require more advanced behavior.
                    Example:
                        function App()
                        {
                            return <Greeting name="John" />;
                        }
    When the App component is rendered, it will display the Greeting component with the name "John", resulting in a greeting message of "Hello, John!".
