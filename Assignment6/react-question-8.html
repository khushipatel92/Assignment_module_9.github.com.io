         Answer:
         
               ->  To check the version of React JS, you can use one of the following methods:
                   1) Using package.json file:
                       You can check the version of React JS in the package.json file of your project.
                       The version number will be listed under the dependencies section for the react package.

                   2) Using the command line:
                      You can use the following command in your terminal or command prompt to check the version of React JS:
