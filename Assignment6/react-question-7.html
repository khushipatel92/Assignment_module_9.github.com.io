                How to install React Js on Windows, Linux Operating System? How to Install NPM and How to check version of NPM?

         Answer:
         
                ->1. Install Node.js:
                     React.js requires Node.js as a prerequisite. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side.
                     Visit the official Node.js website and download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
                     Install Node.js by following the installation instructions.
                         node -v

                 2. Install React using create-react-app (CRA):
                     Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your React project.
                     Run the following command to globally install the Create React App tool:
                         npm install -g create-react-app
                     To verify the installation, type:
                         create-react-app --version

                 3. Create Your React App:
                     Inside your project directory, run:
                         npx create-react-app my-react-app
                     Navigate to the newly created app directory:
                         cd my-react-app

                 4. Check NPM Version:
                     Ensure that your NPM version is at least 5.2.0 or newer (required for create-react-app).
