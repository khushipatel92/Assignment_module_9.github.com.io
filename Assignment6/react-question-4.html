               What is CLI command In React Js?
           
         Answer:
         
                -> CLI stands for Command Line Interface.
                -> It is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with a computer system or application through a command line.
                -> It is a tool that helps developers to quickly set up a React JS project and manage its dependencies.
                -> The CLI provides a set of commands that can be used to create a new project, install dependencies, run tests, and build the project.
                -> In React JS, the term "CLI command" typically refers to commands used in the command line interface (CLI) for managing and setting up React projects.
                -> One popular CLI command in React JS is npx create-react-app my-app, which creates a new React project called "my-app".
                   Note:that npx is a package runner tool that comes with npm.
                       It allows you to run packages without having to install them globally.
                       create-react-app is a package that provides a convenient way to create new React projects with a standard project structure and configuration.
