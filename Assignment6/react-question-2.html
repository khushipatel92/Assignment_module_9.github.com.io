    <!-- Question-2 
      
               What is NPM in React Js?

         Answer:
         
               ->  NPM stands for Node Package Manager, which is the world's largest software registry and package manager.
               ->  It's a crucial tool for managing dependencies in React JS projects.
               ->  In React JS, NPM is used to download and install JavaScript packages from the Node Package Manager registry.
               ->  These packages can be libraries, frameworks, or tools that help with development, testing, and deployment.
               ->  When you create a new React JS project, you'll typically have a package.json file that lists the project's dependencies.
               ->  You can use NPM to install these dependencies by running the command npm install in the project directory.
               ->  npm run build to create a minified production bundle.
